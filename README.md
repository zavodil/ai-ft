AI TOKEN $RAID
===

Every time you send $RAID tokens to a $RAID holder, an AI generates a unique battle between you and the receiver within the original transaction. No UI needed. Just your NEAR wallet and guts to send tokens. Every battle unfolds in the explorer logs - pure, raw blockchain gaming.

Here's the tech part: we're using autonomous agent that analyzes NEAR accounts to create dynamic battle scenarios. Each fight is unique and completely unpredictable. Agent's code is immutable, but note that the temperature for LLM completion is already quite high.

Why NEAR AI? Because we needed smart contracts that can wait for LLM completion, an immutable agent registry, a platform that triggers off-chain agents after on-chain events, FREE LLM completions and fast transaction speeds with low gas fees.

The coolest part? You can raid other $RAID holders. Send tokens to challenge them - if you win, you get their tokens. If you lose, they get yours. No middle ground.

Found someone with 10 $RAID? Send them 10 tokens to trigger a battle. Win = you get their 10 tokens. Lose = they get your 10 tokens. Pure zero-sum gaming.
